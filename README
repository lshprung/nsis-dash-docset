Here is a script and a Makefile for generating a NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) docset for Dash. The script is based on the dash-docset-generation-template

- NSIS: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash
- dash-docset-generation-template: https://github.com/lshprung/dash-docset-generation-template

To generate a docset from the latest edition of the NSIS Manual, simply
execute `make` from the same directory as this README file.
The manual's source is included as in this project's source tree, and is
originally sourced from Debian's nsis-doc package.

Requirements:

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- make    - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- pup     - https://github.com/ericchiang/pup
- sqlite3 - https://www.sqlite.org/index.html
